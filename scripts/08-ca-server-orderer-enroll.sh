# enroll the bootstrap user to get the bootsrap user's cert and key so we can
# create other identities using those cert and key. The bootstrap user is btstrp-orderer
# that was bootstraped with the orderer-ca server init in the previous step.
# The enroll command will create a new msp directory for the btstrp-orderer
# identity in the orderer-ca directory. Thus, the bootstrap user will bex
# our registrar for other identities.

# remember that btstrp-orderer here is not the same as the one registered
# with the tls-ca server. The btstrp-orderer here is a bootstrap user
# that is registered with the orderer-ca server. They have different certificates and keys
# So it has no relation to the btstrp-orderer identity that was registered in tls-ca server.

# usually, we need to register an identity before enrolling it. But in this case,
# the identity is already registered since it's a bootstrap user.
# The --tls.certfiles flag points to the TLS CA's root certificate
# The --mspdir flag points to the directory where the bootstrap user's
# certificate and key will be stored.

# In this case, the --mspdir flag works a little differently.
# For the enroll command, the --mspdir flag indicates where to
# store the generated TLS certificates for the btstrp identity.
